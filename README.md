## Project Goals

Medical Insurance is a contract that requires an insurer to pay some or all of a person's healthcare costs in exchange for a premium, with the insurance typicallly pays for medical expenses incured by the insured. Insurance cost differs from each individual, certain variable may affect a person insurance cost to be higher or lower.

This project will analyze medical insurance cost in a dataset and exploring variables that may affect it. Further, this project will showcase data analysis skills to provide meaningful insight.

## Data Overview

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance "Kaggle | Medical Cost Personal Dataset"). The dataset consist of 7 columns:

- `age`: age of primary beneficiary
- `sex`: insurance contractor gender, male or female
- `bmi`: body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight
- `children`: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents
- `smoker`: is the beneficiary smoking? yes or no
- `region`: the beneficiary's residential area in the US; northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- `charges`: individual medical costs billed by health insurance, in USD

## Insight from Data:
Through working on this dataset, we've found some interesting conclusions:
- Age factors in one's medical insurance cost. In general, higher age individual will pay more insurance cost.
- The average insurance cost is lower for those with normal bmi opposed to overweight and obese bmi.
- Smoking significantly affect medical insurance cost. The average cost difference can reach up to 380%.
