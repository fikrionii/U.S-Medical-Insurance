    "## About The Project\n",
    "***\n",
    "Medical Insurance is a contract that requires an insurer to pay some or all of a person's healthcare costs in exchange for a premium. More specifically, health insurance typically pays for medical, surgical, prescription drug, and sometimes dental expenses incurred by the insured. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, the number of people with health insurance in the U.S. was close to 300 million, about 92 percent of the population. Across the United States, Americans pay different premiums monthly for health insurance. The costs for medical insurance can vary based on certain factors. Some of the factor that accounts for costs are age, location, tobacco use, dependents and plan category ([healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/how-plans-set-your-premiums/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze individual medical insurance cost and variables that may affect it. This project goal are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze multiple variables in meaningful ways that will provide insight into the dataset\n",
    "* Implement Data Analyst skills in a real-world scenario\n",
    "* Utilize Python to model this data in a way that is digestible\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of this Notebook will contain code that is being used to analyze the dataset, as well as any findings. The aim is to provide both insights into the data while also showcasing coding and data analysis skills."

    "The average cost for male smokers is higher than that of female smoker. Interestingly, though, for non-smoker the average insurance cost is **higher** for female than male. One possible reason for this is because women are more likely to go to the doctor and take prescriptions, especially during their reproductive ages between 15 and 44 ([How Health Insurance Premium varies by Gender?](https://life.futuregenerali.in/life-insurance-made-simple/life-insurance/how-health-insurance-premium-varies-by-gender)).\n",

Does this means smoking has greater effect to insurance cost than sex? Or smoking causes more diseases for male than female? This is an example of hypotheses that can be formed by looking at our dataset."
